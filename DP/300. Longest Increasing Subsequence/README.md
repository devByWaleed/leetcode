# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest **strictly increasing subsequence**.

**Subsequence**
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4

```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1

```

### Constraints

* $1 \le$ `nums.length` $\le 2500$
* $-10^4 \le$ `nums[i]` $\le 10^4$

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in $O(n \log n)$ time complexity?
