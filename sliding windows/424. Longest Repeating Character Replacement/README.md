# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

You are given a `string s` and an `integer k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other `uppercase English character`. You can perform this operation at most `k times`.

> Return the `length of the longest substring` containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.


### Example 1

Input `s = ABAB, k = 2`

Output `4`

> Explanation Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.


### Example 2

Input `s = AABABBA, k = 1`

Output `4`

> Explanation Replace the one `'A'` in the middle with `'B'` and form `AABBBBA`.
The `substring BBBB` has the longest repeating letters, which is `4`.
There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.
 

### Constraints

`1 <= s.length <= 10^5`

`s consists of only uppercase English letters.`

`0 <= k <= s.length`
