# Sum of First N Natural Numbers

Given an integer `n`, your task is to compute the sum of all natural numbers from `1` to `n` (inclusive). If `n` is 0, the sum should be 0.


### Example 1

Input: `n = 6`

Output: `21`

> Explanation: The sum of natural numbers up to 6 is: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21


### Example 2

Input: `n = 4`

Output: `10`

> Explanation: The sum of natural numbers up to 4 is: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10


### Example 3

Input: `n = 0`

Output: `0`

> Explanation: Since n is 0, the sum is 0.


### Constraints:
- `0 <= n <= 10^4`


### Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: `O(1)`
- Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`
