# Nth Fibonacci Number

Given a non-negative integer `n`, your task is to find the `nth Fibonacci number`.

The `Fibonacci sequence` is a sequence where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are `0` followed by `1`. The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n > 1


### Example 1

Input: `n = 5`

Output: `5`

> Explanation: The 5th Fibonacci number is 5.


### Example 2

Input: `n = 0`

Output: `0` 

> Explanation: The 0th Fibonacci number is 0.


### Example 3

Input: `n = 1`

Output: `1`

> Explanation: The 1st Fibonacci number is 1.


### Constraints:
- `0 <= n <= 30`


### Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`
