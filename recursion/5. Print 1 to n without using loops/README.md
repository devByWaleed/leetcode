# Print 1 to n without using loops

Given an positive integer `n`, print numbers from `1` to `n` without using loops.

Implement the function `printTillN()` to print the numbers from `1` to `n` as space-separated integers.


### Example 1

Input: `n = 5`

Output: `1 2 3 4 5`

> Explanation: We have to print numbers from 1 to 5.


### Example 2

Input: `n = 10`

Output: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10`

> Explanation: We have to print numbers from 1 to 10.


### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 1000`


### Expected Complexities
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Auxiliary Space: `O(n)`
